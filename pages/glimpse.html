        <div class="col-8 col-sm-8 col-md-8 col-lg-8">
          The first step in our journey was Contextual Inquiry. We wanted to <b>reach out to our target group - people with vision loss or those who are blind, to identify the problems</b> they face in their daily lives.<br><br>
          To connect with them we contacted a few <b>NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) and schools</b> for the blind in India and got conversations going with <b>ABVI Rochester(Association of Blind and Visually Impaired).</b> Moreover, we started threads on message boards of online forums such as AFB (America Foundation for the Blind) inviting people with vision loss or those who are blind for an interview. <br><br>
          We had little success finding out participants due to the sensitivity of our project focus and time constraints. However, we were able to conduct <b>6 full length interviews over phone call and Skype video call.</b> The interview was semi-structured. We began with asking the participant about his/her background, <b>then we inquired about their acquaintance with technology, problems in performing daily tasks and problems</b> in navigating inside and outside their homes. We also gave them a brief idea about our project and asked them for suggestions.

      <div class="col-8 col-sm-8 col-md-8 col-lg-8">
        <p>Analysis of the collected data began with an <b>interpretation session that comprised debriefing of all the participant data and the notes generated from the interviews.</b> The team further discussed existing technology for the people with vision loss or those who are blind, and the technical concepts that applied to those technologies.<br><br>

        With each member taking notes of the discussion, the team decided to meet next day to brainstorm and design an affinity diagram. Each team member used <b>‘Yellow’ Post-it notes to write granular details.</b> We were able to collectively come up with 300 Yellow Notes that had quotes from the interviews and our reflections from the initial research.<br><br>

        The 300 Yellow <b>notes were organized under categories such as 'Technology', 'Environment, 'Culture' </b>etc labeled by 22 Blue Notes. The 22 blue labels were again grouped under more high level categories with <b>8 Pink Labels that helped shape a design strategy.</b> The highest level of hierarchy was denoted by 4 Green Labels of ‘Demography’, ‘Problems’, ‘Analysis’ and ‘Ideation’</p>

          <p>Based on the information acquired from the contextual inquiry we designed sample user personas to give us a <b>quick insight into our potential users as we progressed with the design.</b> We came out with 4 personas in total which constituted one secondary persona. These personas listed user traits such as goals, motivations, frustrations etc reflected by the data gathered from contextual inquiry, combined with characteristic biographical data of a dummy user.

            <p>One of the most common problems discovered among the visually impaired or those who are blind was the inability to find misplaced everyday essentials. To counter this, <b>we conceptualized a coin sized sound-emitting slab tag called 'Glimpse' that could be attached to almost any item</b> such as wallet, medicine box or stationery. The tag was designed work in unison with an app that could be used to assign the slab to an item of choice. <b>To communicate with the slab and make it 'BEEP', a signal from was required to be sent from the app</b> when the user wished to find the item assigned to the slab.

            We <b>added fidelity to our wireframes</b> by adding visual styles, following a color rule and content layout.<br><br>

            Keeping in mind that our users would use the app in Accessibility mode, the <b>touch targets were made bigger</b> in order for them to easily find the options.<br><br>

            The <b>color theme was dark to prevent a lot of bright white light</b> emanating from the screens. OLED screens tend to be too bright which can hurt the eyes.<br><br>

            We used <b>InVision</b> to demonstrate the scenario of adding and removing a tag in addition to finding an item.<br><br>

                <li>Explored a facet in <b>assitive technology and accessible design</b></li>

              <ul>

                <li>Conducted semi-structured interviews with 2 volunteers from ABVI of Rochester</li>
                <li>Consolidate research information and <b>converted data into Product Ideas and Design.</b></li>
                <li>Think from a <b>futuristic technology standpoint</b> and how to combine it with tools available today</li>
                <li>As the person with a bachelors in Electronics and Communications Engineering I weighed in on the <b>technical pros and cons of creating a "Glimpse"</b> tag with exisiting technology.</li>
