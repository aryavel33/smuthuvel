            <h2>Hi, I am Soundarya!</h2>
            <p>
              Given the fact that my portfolio was all business, let me tell you about myself. I am a serious <b>board game addict,</b> you can lure me into a game of Catan at any point during the day and I probably wouldn't say no. <b>I love meeting strangers and talking to them about anything,</b> seriously I once wove a conversation about weather with leadership qualities and cupcakes. Yes, I am <i>that</i> person. <br><br>

              I do use my imagination quite a bit, so <b>I love with working crazy, out of the box thinking and ideas.</b> That is the great thing about working in a UX team, the crazy ideas at least get to the table before reserving them for another day. I like redefining and revamping age old techniques and experimenting with its outcomes. <b>Creative challenges and problem solving excites me</b> and I tend to pay my undivided attention to them. Staring intensely into the screen until it makes sense has become a part of my personality.<br><br>

              Speaking of my personality, I took a personality test, on <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test">16personalities.com</a> not too long ago:<br><br>

              <img class="img-center" src="../assets/about/personality.png" width="90%"><br><br>

              I would pretty much agree with most of the things listed on that picture.<b> I tend to look at positive side of things, even when things look murky.</b> Another quality about myself that I am very proud of is 'loyality'. I am loyal to the work I do and I want it to be the best version of what I can produce.<br><br>

              I started creating GUIs as a Electrical Engineer during my undergraduate degree and realized <b>I have a real passion and aptitude for creating interfaces </b>and I chose to do my Master's in Human Computer Interaction. I also happen to dabble in art (sighes in arteest). I draw, paint and illustrate graphics whenever I find the time to do so. <br><br>

              <b> Let's talk, reach out to me! </b>
