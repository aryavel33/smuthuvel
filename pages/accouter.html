                <br>
                <p> Time and time again, we have heard of the phrase <b>"Dress for the job you want"</b>. So many of us in the tech industry <b>seldom want to spend time on our clothes but still desire to present ourselves better</b>. Like Steve Jobs, you don't have to spend time on dressing up every morning while using Accouter.</p>
                <p>Accoutre is a mobile application for dressing, that is <b>aimed at providing suggestions and allowing its users to pick out clothes</b>, either based on the current weather outside, or the weather throughout the day, or/and based on an occasion or an event that they are to attend, such as a party, wedding, interview, sports activity, and so on, scheduled on their calendar or in their emails.</p>

            Based on the information gathered from our study models â€“ flow models, sequence models, artifact models, physical models, and cultural models, we consolidated our findings into an affinity diagram, and a consolidated sequence model.

		      <ul>
			      <li>Users check the <b>current weather outside or the weather throughout the day</b>, using a reliable weather app, before picking out clothes for that day.</li>
			      <li>They select <b>clothes based on an occasion</b> or an event, such as a party, wedding, interview, sports activity, and so on.</li>
			      <li>They pick out clothes <b>randomly.</b></li>
			      <li>They use applications such as <b>Instagram or Pinterest</b> to follow fashion trends and be aware.</li>

        <p>Flow diagrams helped my team and I <b>identify physical entities, understanding triggers and list both user and application intentions.</b> <br>

          Without the use of our application, the user will:<br>

          <ul>

          <li>Look up <b>weather in forecast app</b> or look outside to determine what they want to wear.</li>
          <li><b>Check their calendar</b> to identify the events they are going to and the dress code required.</li>
          <li>Look through their <b>wardrobe to identify the clothes</b> they want to wear for the day.</li>
          <li><b>Shop for clothes for events</b> they might need in the future. </li>
          <li>Inventory of the clothes that are waiting to be <b>laundered.</b></li>

        </ul>

        Flow models of our app identified three key categories <b>wardrobe (the physical entity), applications used (triggers) and user intentions (nature of interaction).</b></p>

            <p>One of the most interesting things that our team could bring to this project is the <b>different cultural values </b>we have when it comes to dressing day to day. As an Indian, formal clothing is very different to me than what it is to an average American. One of the aspects we would love exploring dress code and fashion for immigrants in various American settings. It will be helpful for <b>anyone travelling abroad to anticipate what type of attire would be socially acceptable</b> in the country they're travelling to.  Getting insight from friends who live in India as well as people in the US, I was able to categorize cultural entities into <b>three sections â€“ Social Setting, Geographical Location and Clothing Trends. </b>

            Even though 2 out of 3 participants were <b>working professionals, they had different dress codes depending on the day and the type of weather they were having.</b> Even though the college student was not restricted by dress code, she was concerned about the latest trends and affordable clothing. All three participants were concerned about the social acceptance of their attire on a day to day basis.
